This repository contains my food ordering website created using HTML and CSS as part of my web development learning journey.

# Reestar – Food Order Landing Page

Reestar is a clean and elegant one-page food ordering website built using pure HTML and CSS. The page features a stylish header with navigation, followed by four visually appealing food cards—each showcasing an image, short description, and an “Order Now” button for quick action. The layout focuses on simplicity, symmetry, and user-friendly design. At the bottom, a minimal contact section allows visitors to connect by submitting their basic details. This project highlights beginner-friendly front-end skills, responsive layout structure.
